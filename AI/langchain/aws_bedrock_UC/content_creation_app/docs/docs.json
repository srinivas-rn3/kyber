Interest on Rs. 20,000, from 15th July \u2013 18th July (4 days) = Rs. 92.05\n2. Interest on Rs.27,000 from 19th July \u2013 1st Aug (14 days) = Rs.434.96\n3. Interest on Rs.27,000 from 2nd Aug \u2013 21st Aug (20 days) = Rs. 621.37\n4. Interest on Rs.25,650 from 22nd Aug \u2013 27th Aug (6 days) = Rs. 177.09\n5.
